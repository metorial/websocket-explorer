## Motivation

We needed a simple tool to test and debug our Websocket APIs. We couldn't find one that was simple and easy to use, so we built one.

Metorial Websocket Explorer aims to be fully featured, yet super simple to use. It allows you to open multiple connections next to each other so you can make sure that broadcasting works as expected. It also has built-in support for JSON messages, so you get nice syntax highlighting and formatting.
